This is my current MacroSystem folder for Dragonfly, using Dragon Naturally Speaking and aenea.

Based originally on DWK's "https://github.com/dwks/aenea-grammar-simple/".

I'm using gitwatch ("https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch") to automatically backup all my changes to git, so expect the git commit messages to look strange in GitHub (but nice & colorful using the "git log" command)!
